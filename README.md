# VectorUGo
Game console with vector display

VectorUGo is a one-player videogame console with vector scan display (like the Vectrex in the 1980s). It is based on an FPGA and its software is written in VHDL language. It has been implemented on a Kamami Maximator MAX10 FPGA board. This repository contains the source files (for compilation with Intel Quartus Prime) as well as the schematic of the electronics which needs to be wired up for vector scan display on a dual trace analog oscilloscope in XY mode (with a z-axis input). It is provided with only one game: Scramble (a classic arcade game of the 1980s).
